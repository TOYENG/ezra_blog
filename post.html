                    <p>What It Means
Basically, what this quote means is that the best feeling in life can be attained through showing people that said you couldn't, that you actually could.
Proving people wrong and not limiting yourself by what others say you should and can or cannot do.
You should define yourself and when ever someone tells you that you aren't capable of doing something, show them that you can do it and that you can even do it better. Showing people that you are capable of doing what they think you can't is better than any revenge because you showed them that they were wrong, and you may have even gained a few things in the process.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Knowledge speaks but wisdom listens</h2>

                    <p>Too often in life we seek only to be heard instead of truly listening to, and understanding those who matter to us most– the ones that we love in this world. Jimi knew, and it would serve us well (me especially) to heed his wise words. At the end of the day, it’s the love that we give and receive– in other words, relationships, that make this life beautiful and worth living. Sometimes we must decrease so that the relationship can increase. After all, what’s more important–  being happy, or proving how smart we are and being right all the time?</p>

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Take a moment and breathe</h2>

                    <p>It's always nice when you do something and it's well received as opposed to the other way which God knows happens to everybody. When the good times come around, you take a deep breath, appreciate it, but not take it too seriously.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>I just want people to take a step back, take a deep breath and actually look at something with a different perspective. But most people will never do that.</p>

                    <p>During a panic attack, I remember that today is just today and that is all that it is. I take a deep breath in and I realize that in this moment I am fine and everything is okay. More importantly, I am reminded that my A.P.C. jeans are so perfectly worn in that they are appropriate for any season and I am suddenly at ease.</p>
					<p>You can talk yourself into a good emotional state. I stop for a second, take a deep breath, and think about something that's beautiful. A beautiful thought for me is cutting the umbilical cord for my child. I can guarantee you that your emotional state will change.</p>
					<p>I have so much chaos in my life, it's become normal. You become used to it. You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how they're wrong.</p>
					<p>I don't care who you are, you're going to choke in certain matches. You get to a point where your legs don't move and you can't take a deep breath. You start to hit the ball about a yard wide, instead of inches.</p>
					<p>Sometimes when I hear criticism of my husband, I want to come out of my seat and clock somebody. But you learn to take a deep breath.</p>
					<p>What about the rat race in the first place? Is it worthwhile? Or are you just buying into someone else's definition of success? Only you can decide that, and you'll have to decide it over and over and over. But if you think it's a rat race, before you drop out, take a deep breath. Maybe you picked the wrong job. Try again. And then try again.</p>
					<p>I love standing up behind the blocks, and I love that moment just before you dive in and it goes quiet, and you take a deep breath and you just dive, and then you try and win, but that moment just before I go, that's why I race.</p>
					<p>Certainly in the Capitol you do get moments were you sort of take a deep breath and think of all the historic figures who have been in that building, like Abraham Lincoln, who have stood right in those same rooms to make the landmark decisions.</p>
